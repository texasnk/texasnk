ðŸ‘‹ðŸ™‚ Hi, I'm Davi, also known as [**@texasnk**](https://github.com/texasnk)

I like the idea of sharing my progress in development, so you can find almost everything that I'm currently studying or have studied here.

My current focus is on back-end development, specifically building RESTful APIs using C# (.NET Framework / ASP.NET Core) and connecting them to MySQL databases. I'm also using Postman to help me in the process of building, testing, and documenting my APIs.

In my repositories section, you can find some of the projects I'm currently working on, as well as some I've completed in the past. I'm always learning and trying out new technologies, so you can expect to see new things added over time.
